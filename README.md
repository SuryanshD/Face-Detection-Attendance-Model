# Face Detection Attendance Model using ML in Java

This project focuses on automating attendance management using face detection and recognition techniques implemented in Java. The system uses Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to detect faces from images or real-time video streams, recognize individuals, and record their attendance.

## Features

- **Face Detection**: Utilizes OpenCV or another Java-compatible library for detecting faces in images or live video.
- **Face Recognition**: Implements a face recognition model (such as Eigenfaces, Fisherfaces, or CNN-based models) to identify individuals from detected faces.
- **Attendance Logging**: Records attendance automatically based on recognized faces and timestamps.
- **User Interface**: Provides a user-friendly interface for interaction and monitoring.
- **Database Integration**: Stores attendance records in a database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) for future analysis and reporting.
- **Deployment**: Guidelines for deploying the system in various environments, including setup instructions.

## Requirements

Specify the necessary dependencies and libraries required to run the project:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- OpenCV (Java bindings) or a compatible face detection library
- (Add any other specific libraries or tools required)

## Usage

1. **Setup**: Configure the system to connect with your camera or image source.
2. **Face Detection**: Initiate face detection and recognition processes.
3. **Attendance Recording**: Automatically log attendance for recognized faces.
4. **Monitoring**: Use the provided interface to monitor attendance status and logs.
